# Alberto's project
- Project-01: Movie Project: This project covers HTML structure, CSS grid, React layout, components creation, movie form, data management, listings, editing/deleting movies, search engine, error messages &amp; diverse styling (header, navigation, cards, buttons, sidebar, footer).
- Project-02: Routes: One of the most important things in a framework like React is routing. From this point we will be able to create SPA applications (single page application). To work with routing we are going to create a new project: npx create-react-app 07-routes.
